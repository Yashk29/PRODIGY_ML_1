Introduction
This project aims to predict the median value of houses using various regression techniques. The main tasks include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training and tuning, evaluation, and interpretation.

Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: House Price Dataset.

The dataset contains the following columns (these columns should be adapted to your specific dataset):

CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
DIS: weighted distances to five employment centers
RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
TAX: full-value property tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black people by town
LSTAT: % lower status of the population
MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s
Data Preprocessing
Identified and removed missing values.
Standardized columns using Min-Max normalization and standard scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Generated histograms, box plots, and distribution plots for each column.
Computed and visualized a correlation matrix using a heatmap.
Generated pair plots for key variables.
Feature Engineering
Applied Min-Max normalization and standard scaling.
Removed highly correlated features to prevent multicollinearity.
Model Training and Evaluation
Several regression models were trained and evaluated:

Ridge Regression: with hyperparameter tuning for regularization strength.
Decision Tree Regressor: with hyperparameter tuning for maximum depth and minimum samples split.
Extra Trees Regressor: with hyperparameter tuning for the number of estimators, maximum depth, and minimum samples split.
XGBoost Regressor: with hyperparameter tuning for the number of estimators, learning rate, and maximum depth.
Training Function
A custom training function was created to perform hyperparameter tuning, model fitting, and evaluation using cross-validation.

Evaluation Metrics
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
R-squared (R²)
Model Interpretation
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were used to interpret the models and understand the impact of each feature on the predictions.

Model Comparison
Model performance was compared using evaluation metrics and visualized using bar plots.

Requirements
The following Python libraries are required:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
shap
opendatasets
Install the required packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost shap opendatasets
Usage
Download the dataset from Kaggle.
Run the script to preprocess the data, perform EDA, train models, and evaluate performance.
Compare the models using the provided visualizations and metrics.
Results
The results section includes the best hyperparameters for each model, evaluation metrics, and SHAP value visualizations. The models were compared based on their MSE, MAE, and R² scores.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of various machine learning models for predicting house prices. Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Extra Trees, and XGBoost Regressors were trained and evaluated. SHAP values provided insights into feature importance, and model comparison highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
